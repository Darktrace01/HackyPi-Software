2. * Install **CircuitPython** in RoundyPi
     Insert the circuit python to the roundypi(it is circuit python firmware "adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-7.1.1.uf2"). for this first you need to          press the boot button then connect the USB, don,t release the button until you connect the USB to the laptop. then you see a new device named "RPI-RP2" drag this         file "adafruit-circuitpython- raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-7.1.1.uf2" to this device as shown in figure:
     this is the official website, or yoy can download from here https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/
